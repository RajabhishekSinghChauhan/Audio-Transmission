The project is about transmitting and receiving audio data over a network using sockets. Here’s a brief description of how it works based on the two required files (prosender.py and pro.py):

prosender.py (Server Transmitting Audio)
    •	Functionality: This script captures audio data and sends it to a client over a TCP connection.
    •	Key Steps:
        1.	Audio Capture: Uses the pyshine library to capture audio in 'send' mode.
        2.	Socket Setup: Creates a TCP socket and binds it to a specified IP address and port.
        3.	Listening for Connections: Listens for incoming client connections.
        4.	Transmitting Audio: Once a client connects, it continuously captures audio frames, serializes them using pickle, and sends them to the client using the socket.
        
pro.py (Client Receiving Audio)
    •	Functionality: This script receives audio data from the server and plays it.
    •	Key Steps:
        1.	Audio Setup: Uses the pyshine library to set up audio capture in 'get' mode and shows the audio plot.
        2.	Socket Setup: Creates a TCP socket and connects to the server’s IP address and port.
        3.	Receiving Data: Continuously receives data packets from the server, deserializes them using pickle, and adds the audio frames to the audio buffer for playback.
        
Overall Project Flow
    1.	Server Side (prosender.py):
        o	Captures audio data.
        o	Serializes the audio frames.
        o	Sends the serialized audio frames to the client.
    2.	Client Side (pro.py):
        o	Connects to the server.
        o	Receives serialized audio frames.
        o	Deserializes the audio frames.
        o	Plays the received audio.
        
This setup allows real-time audio transmission from a server to a client over a TCP connection.
